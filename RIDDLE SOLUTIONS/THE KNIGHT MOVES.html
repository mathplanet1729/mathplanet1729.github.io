        <h1>SOLUTION - THE KNIGHT MOVES</h1>
        <h2>QUESTION<SPAN> (Riddle 10)</SPAN> </h2>
        <p>I have a calculator that can display ten digits. How many different ten-digit numbers can I type using just the 0-9 keys once each, and moving from one keypress to the next using the knight’s move in chess? (In chess, the knight move in an L-shape – one square up and two across, two squares down and one across, two squares up and one across, and other like combinations)<br><br>

            <h2>ANSWER</h2>
            <p>You can form the numbers 5034927618 and 5038167294. You can also form their reverses: 8167294305 and 4927618305. Hence four different numbers can be made. The key point is to realize that the number must start or end on the ‘5’ key, followed/preceded by the ‘0’ key, otherwise, there is no way of using all ten keys during the route.<br>
