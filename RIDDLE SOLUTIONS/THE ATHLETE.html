        <h2>QUESTION<SPAN> (Riddle 8)</SPAN> </h2>
        <p>An athlete is able to jump FOREVER. However, everytime that she jumps she gets a bit more tired, and every jump goes 12 as far as her prior jump. Now, for her very first jump, she goes 12 of a foot.
            <bR>
            On her second jump, she goes 14 of a foot, and so on and so forth. The beginning of her journey is shown in the gif below.<br><br>

            How many jumps does it take for her to travel 1 foot?<br>

            <h2>ANSWER</h2>
            <p>She will <mark>never</mark> get to the 1 foot mark because you keep adding smaller and smaller amounts!<br>
