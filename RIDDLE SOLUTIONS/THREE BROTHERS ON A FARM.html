        <h1>SOLUTION - THREE BROTHERS ON A FARM</h1>
        <h2>QUESTION<SPAN> (Riddle 6)</SPAN> </h2>
        <p>Three brothers live in a farm. They agreed to buy new seeds: Adam and Ben would go and Charlie stayed to protect fields. Ben bought 75 sacks of wheat in the market whereas Adam bought 45 sacks. At home, they split the sacks equally. Charlie had paid 1400 dollars for the wheat. How much dollars did Ben and Adam get of the sum, considering equal split of the sacks?<br><br>

            <h2>ANSWER</h2>
            <p>This has to be solved like this:<br><br>
                <mark>Every farmer's part is <strong><span id="calculation">¹∕₃</span></strong>(45 + 75) = 40 sacks.<bR>
                    Charlie paid $1400 for 40 sacks, then 1 sack costs $1400/40 = $35/sack.<br><br>
                    
                    Adam got $35(45 − 40) = 35 <strong><span id="calculation">X</span></strong> 5 = $175.<br>
                    Ben got $35(75 − 40) = 35 <strong><span id="calculation">X</span></strong> 35 = $1225.<br>    
                    Final Answer: Ben $1225, Adam $175</mark><br>
